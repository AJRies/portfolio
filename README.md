Here is my mock up website for module 2 challenge.
It includes a functional, albeit eye-sore of a website. The nav links all guide you to the areas of note. More pictures are needed.
The one picture of my original challenge links to the github webpage.
This was a learning experience that proves I need to provide more time to development off hours.
